# Ultrasonic Sensor with PIC16F877a

## Description:
his project uses a PIC16F877A microcontroller to measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor. Based on the measured distance, it lights up different LEDs. The setup involves connecting the ultrasonic sensor and LEDs to specific pins on the microcontroller

## Hardware Connenctins: 
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:**
  - Trigger: RB0
  - Echo: RB4

- **LEDs:**
  - LED on RC0: Lights up when the distance is ≤ 10 cm
  - LED on RC1: Lights up when the distance is ≤ 7 cm
  - LED on RC2: Lights up when the distance is ≤ 4 cm
  - LED on RC3: Lights up when the distance is ≤ 2 cm
